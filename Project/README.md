# Image Classification with Kernels
#### Team members: Peter Martigny, Sophia Lazraq, Olivier Chanc√©

The goal of this project is to classify images from (CIFAR dataset)[https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html], which consist of 10 different classes: airplane, dog, cat, car, horse, frog, truck, bird, deer, ship.

The constraint of this project is: DO IT YOURSELF! which means no access to machine learning libraries (keras, sklearn, opencv...)

## Methodology

#### Fetures creation with SIFT
Build a SIFT features extractor

#### Chi2 Kernel
Build a Chi2 Kernel to embed the features

#### SVM
Build a Support Vector Machine (SVM) to classify images, with a one-versus-all method to go multi-class

### Additional Trick: Data Augmentation
Flip the images to double the size of the training set

## Results
The metrics of concern is the accuracy
On the prvate leaderaboard, our model without data augmentation produces an accuracy of 63.5%.
With data augmentation, the model lead to an accuracy of 65.5%
